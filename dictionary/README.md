# Dictionary

![alt text](https://github.com/proman3419/Scripts-and-tools/blob/master/dictionary/screenshot.png)

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Requests 2.21.0

## Usage
The script can be used for checking a specific word:

```python3 dictionary.py word```

It can be used for obtaining a random word from the dictionary:

```python3 dictionary.py```

Unfortunately the second option doesn't include all words from the dictionary, because of the API's results limit.
